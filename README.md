Path Icons is a lightweight, customizable icon solution inspired by Bootstrap Icons. It allows you to use only the icons you need, add two-tone color support, and easily integrate custom icons. Designed for web applications (via Node.js and npm module path-icons) and cross-platform desktop apps built with Avalonia and WPF.


## Why Path Icons?

- **Selective Icon Usage**: Include only the icons your app needs, avoid bundling the full `bootstrap-icons.woff2` and `bootstrap-icons.min.css`.
- **Two-Tone Colors**: Enhance Bootstrap Icons with dual-color support for better visual appeal.
- **Custom Icons**: Simplify the process of adding and managing your own icons.
- **Cross-Platform**: Seamlessly use the same icons in web and desktop applications (Avalonia, WPF).

**This project is under construction. More details coming soon!**
